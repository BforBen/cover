Introducing Cover
===

Cover is a content-driven blogging theme for WordPress. Built on top of Automattic’s _s (Underscores) and bundled with Font Awesome, Cover allows you to focus on your writing. There are no sidebars to mess with, just a single column view of your content.

##Features

Cover is designed to be responsive. No matter the device or screen size, Cover always looks beautiful.

Drawing special attention to featured images, from the homepage to posts, category archives to pages, your blog is made uniquely yours through your images. Of course, you don’t _have_ to use images. Cover’s clean typography lets your writing stand on its own.

###Full-width featured images

When you use a featured image in Cover, it displays it as a background image behind the title. Images taller than 600 pixels will be displayed full-screen.

###Scalable vector icons

Cover is bundled with Font Awesome v4.2, allowing you to include any of its 479 icons on any post or page.

###Built for Aesop Story Engine

Cover was built from the ground up with ASE support in mind. Full-width components like images, galleries, maps, and more 

###Social menus



###Built with Sass

If you’re a developer and want to play around with Cover, you’ll find that its default style.css stylesheet is nearly empty. This is because while WordPress requires this stylesheet, I prefer to build and compress the theme’s styles using Sass. To that end, in the project you’ll find the `/sass` folder which holds all the components required to compile the _real_ stylesheet, including Font Awesome styles. (Similarly, the JavaScript used in Cover is compressed, but the uncompressed code is provided in the `/js/src` directory.)
